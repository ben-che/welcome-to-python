# Hi Vinh, welcome to Python 3
Here's a quick crash course on Python and important CS concepts (WIP lol)

# Introduction
**What is Python?**
- A general purpose programming language from the 80s - although it's a bit of the older side it's still being used extensively today, with the 5th largest StackOverflow community, and one of the most in-demand languages in the data industry
- We'll be using Python 3 as opposed to Python 2. The big ideas between the two languagues are still the same, the syntax is just a bit different

**Why Python?**
- Python handles a lot of under-the-hood complexities for its user, so you can pretty much focus on writing code that functions without worrying about things like memory management
- Python is probably one of the better first imperative languages to learn because it's written like English. It's quite easy to pick up, and you don't have to worry about the low level problems you would encounter in a language like C++, yet it's strict enough to throw errors and will not fail silently (yikes, Javascript)
- You can also build backends, pipelines, mine data - you can do almost anything with Python
